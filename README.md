#Back To Top jQuery plugin
**Version 1.0**

##Description
Originally built as a custom widget for the PGeStore rxd redesign, several global dependencies have been removed for this version. The code has been stripped down and refactored to be used as a plugin.

##How it works
When scrolling back up the widget will appear, giving the user the option to quickly scroll back to the top of the page. This is a nice widget to add for pages with lots of scrolling content.

##Requirements
1. jQuery 1.9.1+
* Sass 3.2+
* position: fixed

##Usage
<pre>
// Called on a jQuery object
$('.your-selector').backToTop();

/**
    Settable Options
    pageOffset: 200,
    haltFadeSpeed: 3000

    $('.your-selector').backToTop({
        pageOffset: 1.0,
        haltFadeSpeed: 300
    });
*/
</pre>

## Setup

HTML5 Starter Kit for Front End Development at Resource
=====

This a customized version of HTML5 Boilerplate that aligns with our best practices (as outlined in the [Front End Development Standards & Best Practices documentation](https://insider.resource.com/docs/DOC-1192)) as well as other starter kits. This is the official Resource HTML5 Starter Kit. **The goal is to have an HTML template that we use to start Front End Projects.**

## Setup for new project

````
	cd *your-local-workspace*
	git clone ssh://git@stash.resource.com:7999/vcl/resource-html5-starter-kit.git
	rm -rf .git
	git init
	git add --all
	git commit -m "Initial commit"
	git remote add origin *new-repository-location*
	git push -u origin master
````
Note: you will need to create a Git repository from your Git account online in order to obtain your repository location.
Instructions assume that you have added an [SSH key](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH023/Adding+an+SSH+key+to+your+Stash+profile+on+Windows) to your Stash profile.

After completing the above, start developing your new project.

## Usemin Blocks

These are located in the index.html file and they add hooks for the grunt usemin builder. Anything in these blocks will be concatenated and minified during the grunt build task in the order they are listed.

**CSS Block**

````
    <!-- build:css assets/css/styles.css -->
    <!-- This file is generated from the scss directory and any files that are in the css directory
    - any plugin css should be added to the /assets/css directory and they will be concatenated to the end of the styles.css file
    - all of the css files added to this build block will be concatenated into the styles.css file by the usemin grunt task -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/styles.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/plugin.css" />
    <!-- endbuild -->
````
**JS Block**

````
    <!-- build:js assets/js/main.js -->
    <!-- Additional JS Libraries and Frameworks Here
     - List the js files and libraries below inside of the build block in the order you want them concatenated on build
     - This block is parsed by the usemin grunt task and it generates one main.js file for production -->
    <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script>
    <script src="/assets/js/plugin.js"></script>
    <!-- endbuild -->
````

---

## Running Locally with Grunt
The *HTML5 Starter Kit* comes with a [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) script that builds the project into a \_compiled folder, compiles scss and minifies it, concatenates js/css files included in the index.html build blocks and minifies them along with gzip compression, optimizes all of the images (png,jpg,jpeg,webp), performs a direct copy of assets/fonts/, assets/media/ and assets/js/libs directories into \_compiled, and updates all of the links in the index file to reference the new minified files.

### Grunt Installation
The Grunt task requires the following dependencies: [Node](http://nodejs.org/), [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/), and [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) (for Windows).

```
	cd _grunt/
	npm install

```

### Grunt Server - Run it!
Launch a node server that compiles scss and fires a new browser tab with livereload that transforms you into a ROCK STAR!!!

```
	cd _grunt/
	grunt server
```

#### Custom Port
By default the port is `8989` but you can override it by doing the following:

```
	grunt server --port <enter-port-number>
```

### Server for Compiled application
This task will launch the node server with the compiled production code in the _compiled directory

````
    grunt server:dist
````

### Grunt Build
Builds the project into a _compiled folder, compiles scss and minifies it, concatenates js/css files included in the index.html build blocks and minifies them along with gzip compression, optimizes all of the images (png,jpg,jpeg,webp), performs a direct copy of assets/fonts/, assets/media/ and assets/js/libs directories into dist, and updates all of the links in the index file to reference the new minified files. By default, the build will output to: `_compiled/`

```
	cd _grunt/
	grunt build
```

### Grunt Clean
Remove all .sass-cache, .tmp and _compiled/... *just because it's a nice option*

```
	cd _grunt/
	grunt cleanall
```

---

## Sass Setup (without grunt)

### Install Sass
Sass is written in Ruby, so youâ€™ll need Ruby installed as well. If you're using OS X, it's already there. Windows users can get it via the [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) for Windows. Linux users can install it with their package manager. Once you have Ruby installed, run the following from the command line to install Sass:

```
gem install sass
```

### Sass --watch
Tell Sass to watch the file and update the CSS every time the Sass file changes:

```
cd assets/
sass --watch scss:css --style compressed
```

**`--style compressed` is not required for development, but it is recommended for production compile of your .scss files**. Read more about Sass compile styles and options: [http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#options](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html).

---

## Directory Structure
Almost every developer has their preferred way of setting up the directory structure. The *HTML5 Starter Kit* aims to create a common structure that can be used for the majority of projects.
With the focus on reusable code (paths of images in CSS, sass --watch, etc), the directory structure of `/assets` is required for Resource development projects unless system (CMS, SI, Client, Platform) has a predefined structure or limitations.
